#Breadboard

This is a project that was made to satisfy an intellectual curiosity. In my university, when we study the subject of DLD, Digital Logic Design, we have to perform lab tasks in which we put together circuits using 747 ICs and breadboards. When using regular wire on a breadboard, the whole circuit can easily become very messy as the wires get tangled. This project aims to solve the problem of "Clean Breadboard Circuit Design". Even though there is very less practical usage for this outside the lab, as breadboards aren't as widely used, and PCB design software are available more widely.
